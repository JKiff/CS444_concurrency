\section{Explanation of Flags in qemu Command-Line}
\label{sec:flags}

\subsection{-gdb Flag}
The -gdb flag sets up a gdb server to allow us to connect to the kernel using gdb and the port that is provided as the argument next on the command line.

\subsection{-kernel Flag}
-kernel bzImage use 'bzImage' as kernel image\\
Provide the location of the kernel image to use. The kernel image is a .bz compressed file.

\subsection{-S Flag}
"Freezes" CPU at startup. 'c' can be used to start execution.

\subsection{-nographic Flag}
Disables graphical output and redirects serial I/Os to console.  

\subsection{-drive Flag}
file=file -- use 'file' as a drive image.
The -drive option allows you to specify the location of the drive image you want to use. Additional options are available and supplied via comma-separated-values to specify further information about the drive image. On our command line we have also specified the 'if' option which specifies the type of the file system (virtio).

\subsection{-enable-kvm Flag}
Enables KVM full virtualization support so that operating systems and programs can run on entirely virtual hardware.

\subsection{-net Flag}
Use of '-net' without any options or '-net none' indicates zero network devices.

\subsection{-usb Flag}
Enable the USB driver.

\subsection{-localtime Flag}
Specify the RTC option. Other options are 'utc' and 'date'.

\subsection{--no-reboot Flag}
Exits instead of rebooting. Adding this option will not allow the VM to reboot, so no reboot upon execution.

\subsection{--append Flag}
-append cmdline use 'cmdline' as kernel command line
Adds extra option to the kernel command line.


\section{Concurrency Assignment}
\begin{question}{1}
What do you think the main point of this assignment is?
\end{question}

To refamiliarize ourselves with C. We have had prior experience in OS1 with programming in parallel. This assignment gets us thinking back to our experiences programming in parallel and to demonstrate this through a producer-consumer problem.

\begin{question}{2}
How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc.
\end{question}

We started working on the problem from the bottom up. We started with what we knew how to code, the data structure for the buffer nodes. Then we worked on getting the randomization to work. After we tested that the randomization worked, we started working on creating consumers and producers to add and remove nodes from our buffer. Finally, we added in the assembly code to use rdrand if it can be used on the host. 

\begin{question}{3}
How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.
\end{question}

To ensure our solution was correct, we tested using various numbers of consumers and producers. We found that using only one consumer and one producer would cause the buffer to remain fairly empty most of the time. We also tested our program using 32 producers and 1 consumer to cause our buffer to reach the maximum limit to ensure that the buffer didn't overflow.

\begin{question}{4}
What did you learn?
\end{question}

We learned more about some of the other random number generators, like rdrand and Mersenne Twister, and the difference between how these functions generate random numbers. In addition, we also discovered how to write in-line assembly.

\section{Work Log}

\textit{\textbf{23 September, 2018}} \\\\
\textbf{Kernel:} \\\\
\indent Today we attempted to get everything set up for the kernel. As the assignment had not been assigned yet we were trying to get a head start by looking through McGrath's assignment 1 description. We split up the work and all followed the command line options we wrote out at the top of this report. We attempted to start the emulator using the qemu command, we saw it stop and wait for execution from the GDB command. We were unable to connect to the tcp port with GDB at this point as the instructions seemed to be unclear to us.
\\\\
\textbf{Concurrency:} \\\\
\indent We started development on the concurrency assignment, working to get the Mersenne Twister to generate random values. We were able to do this, create a makefile, and get the git repository set up. We then started looking into and experimenting with different ways to output the git log into a table form.
\\\\

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{25 September, 2018}} \\\\
\textbf{Kernel:} \\
\indent Did not make any changes to kernel.
\\\\
\textbf{Concurrency:} \\
\indent Got the initial functionality working with a baseline makefile. These changes introduced the producer and consumer functionality to the script but some additional changes such as the rdrand32 needs to be implemented and code should be cleaned up. Previously we had added the struct and baseline c code to the file. Today we made changes that added the producer and consumer functionality. Comments need to be added.
\\\\

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{26 September, 2018}} \\\\
\textbf{Kernel:} \\
\indent No kernel changes.
\\\\
\textbf{Concurrency:} \\
\indent Added comments to concurrency code.
\\\\

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{27 September, 2018}} \\\\
\textbf{Documentation:} \\
\indent We then worked on our makefile for tex and committed both our makefile and an initial set of documentation written in tex.
\\\\

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{26 September, 2018}} \\\\
\textbf{Kernel:} \\
\indent No kernel changes.
\\\\
\textbf{Concurrency:} \\
\indent No concurrency changes.
\\\\

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{2 October, 2018}} \\\\
\textbf{Kernel:} \\
\indent We had struggled to run and connect GDB to the kernel that was waiting for us earlier. Today we asked questions during recitation and then went to office hours with the teacher to ask about it. Immediately we realized it was because prior to connecting with GDB we did not source the environment file. Once we found this out we were able to connect with GDB using \$GDB and had no problems.
\\\\
\textbf{Concurrency:} \\
\indent No concurrency changes.
\\\\

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{6/7 October, 2018}} \\\\
\textbf{Kernel:} \\
\indent No kernel changes.
\\\\
\textbf{Concurrency:} \\
\indent We investigated the rdrand32 and implemented it in the concurrency code.
\\\\

\noindent
\textit{\textbf{11 October, 2018}} \\\\
\textbf{Documentation:} \\
\indent We got together to work on completing the assignment to turn it in, we cleaned up the documentation, and added our work and commit log.
\\\\
\textbf{Concurrency:} \\
\indent Fixed a minor printing issue to make sure it prints out the buffer size properly.
